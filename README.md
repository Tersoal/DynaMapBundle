tersoal/dynamapbundle
=====================

The DynaMap Bundle is a Symfony2 bundle that brings you the possibility to handle entities dynamically.
Doctrine requires defining all entities and their properties and methods in classes. But now you can
define your database tables and their fields upon model entities (with some field restrictions by the moment).

All is decoupled and you can customize your models, master and field entities to fit your needs.
